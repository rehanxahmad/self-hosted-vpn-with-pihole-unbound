# Split tunnel (DNS only): 10.6.0.1/32
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

# Configuration Notes:
# - Replace <CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY> with generated client key
# - Replace <SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY> with server's public key  
# - Replace <SERVER_IP> with your AWS Elastic IP address
# - Replace <CLIENT_NUMBER> with unique number (2, 3, 4, etc.)
# - Modify AllowedIPs for split vs full tunneling
